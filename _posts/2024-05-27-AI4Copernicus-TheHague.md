## AI4Copernicus workshop and conference on soil and water

The TAPAS group were represented at the AI4Copernicus “Benelux day for shared challenges on water, infrastructure and soil monitoring” by Jemima O’Farrell and new group member Pearse Murphy.  

Hosted by the Netherlands space office, AI4Copernius was a space for experts in Earth Observation (EO) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to highlight some recent achievements. The meeting was opened with a video message from Mark Harbers, Dutch Minister for Infrastructure and Water Management, who stressed the importance of EO in the face of challenges posed by climate change. 

The team attended thematic sessions dedicated to subsidence monitoring and water, predominantly in a Benelux context. They also learned about different applications of SAR data as part of the radar data for water and soil workshop, which was held one day prior to AI4Copernicus. 

The two days provided the team with a great opportunity to connect with new colleagues and learn how best to implement SAR data within the TAPAS project.
