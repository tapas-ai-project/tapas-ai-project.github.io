Dashboards are a widely used tool for gaining quick and useful insights into the current state of your data. A dashboard will usually give you a overview of all data streams and what they look like. This is particularly convenient if you have live data streams that are constantly being updated. Without data streams however, a dashboard can be advantageous for simple insights into complex data.

In particular, for TAPAS, or any earth observation management, it is useful to see the raw data distilled into indices of interest (such as NDVI), or a time-series for a particular region of interest. 

There are many open-source options for completing this task, but one of the most straight-forward is [https://docs.streamlit.io](streamlit).
