Poster Presentation - Quantifying The Impact of Climate-Change-Induced Desertification In Agrifood Production In Senegal Using BIOMASS

Attending the recent ESA Polinsar & BIOMASS conference in Toulouse last week was an absolute pleasure. The presentations were a very comprehensive insight into the world of Pol-InSAR and its developing applications within a wide variety of fields in EO, from deforestation to desertification. We presented our work on soil moisture retrievals from SAR and had the opportunity to speak with others who are also interested in monitoring soil moisture, particularly in arid climates along the Sahel. This is a topic of increasing interest as water has become one of the most valuable resources in the battle to maintain viable farming practices in the Senegal River Valley. Our team at TAPAS has returned with lots of information to delve into further concerning PolInSAR applications in Climate Change impact monitoring.
