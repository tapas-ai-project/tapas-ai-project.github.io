The TAPAS group attended this year’s International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) congress dedicated to abolishing poverty and hunger among people and populations that rely on rice-based agri-food systems. The Congress was convened in Manila, Philippines with the central theme of accelerating rice-based agri-systems with over 2000 delegates representing the entire rice value chain in attendance. The discussions, sessions and plenary talks with a wide range of participants from scientists, experts, and decision-makers to global governments, industry, private and public sectors centred on accelerating the transformation of rice-based food systems. Specialized events and activities of interest to all stakeholders, from the scientific and research communities to National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems (NARES) and regional development organizations presented evidence-based solutions to the principal challenges facing the global rice sector.
