Title:  TAPAS in-person planning workshop with CGIAR partners in Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT.

The recent in-person planning workshop of our interdisciplinary Tracking Adaptation Progress in Agricultural Systems (TAPAS) Project took place with our CGIAR <https://www.cgiar.org/> partners in Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT<https://alliancebioversityciat.org/> headquarters in Rome.

Our TAPAS research team is developing AI-enabled satellite remote sensing methodologies for measuring productivity, emissions and adaptation in agricultural systems. To date, we have been developing a range of prototype methods and pipelines for AI-enabled satellite remote sensing of cropping systems, where we are co-developing use cases in partnership with a range of CGIAR System-wide Initiatives, including MITIGATE+, AMD, ClimBer and Climate Security. Our TAPAS project planning meeting was also attended by representatives from the European Space Agency - ESA<https://www.esa.int/> and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency<https://www.unhcr.org/>, with whom there are significant opportunities for impactful synergies with the TAPAS project.


The Science Foundation Ireland<https://www.sfi.ie/> and Department of Foreign Affairs, Ireland<https://www.dfa.ie/> / Irish Aid <https://www.irishaid.ie/> funded TAPAS project is an AI for Societal Good Challenge Project, co-led by Charles Spillane<https://ie.linkedin.com/in/charles-spillane-a0580813> and Aaron Golden<https://ie.linkedin.com/in/aaron-golden-3701a286> from University of Galway<https://www.universityofgalway.ie/>, in partnership with Ana Maria Loboguerrero<https://it.linkedin.com/in/ana-maria-loboguerrero-3b0397a3/en> and Louis Reymondin<https://ch.linkedin.com/in/louis-reymondin-a190545> from the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT.
