## TAPAS in-person planning workshop with CGIAR partners in Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT.

The recent in-person planning workshop of our interdisciplinary Tracking Adaptation Progress in Agricultural Systems (TAPAS) Project took place with our <a href="https://www.cgiar.org/"> CGIAR </a> partners in Alliance of Bioversity International and <a href="https://alliancebioversityciat.org/"> CIAT </a> headquarters in Rome.

Our TAPAS research team is developing AI-enabled satellite remote sensing methodologies for measuring productivity, emissions and adaptation in agricultural systems. To date, we have been developing a range of prototype methods and pipelines for AI-enabled satellite remote sensing of cropping systems, where we are co-developing use cases in partnership with a range of CGIAR System-wide Initiatives, including MITIGATE+, AMD, ClimBer and Climate Security. Our TAPAS project planning meeting was also attended by representatives from the European Space Agency - <a href="https://www.esa.int/"> ESA </a> and UNHCR, the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/"> UN Refugee Agency </a>, with whom there are significant opportunities for impactful synergies with the TAPAS project.
