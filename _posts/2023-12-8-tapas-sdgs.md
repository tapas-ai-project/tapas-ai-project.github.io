TAPAS unites intergovernmental organizations, government, civil society and academic research partners to accelerate action towards SDG implementation and promote the sustainable management of our natural resources.

The TAPAS group provides a powerful toolkit by integrating Earth Observation (EO), and AI solutions to support targeted interventions and advance progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). TAPAS solutions monitor agricultural practice, crop health and land use to offer impartial insight into food production and provide alert systems for areas that are at risk of acute food insecurity. TAPAS provides real-time analyses of climate data and climate modelling to predict extreme climate shock and inform strategies for climate mitigation and adaptation (SDG13).
The TAPAS group facilitates international collaboration to meet ‘Partnerships for the Goals’ (SDG 17) through technology transfer, data sharing and collaboration.  TAPAS has the capacity to monitor Zero Hunger targets (SDG 2) by analysing data to predict crop yields, assess the impact of climate change on agriculture and optimize resource allocation for sustainable food production. It's service can monitor water-related challenges including pollution events and optimize water resource management.
