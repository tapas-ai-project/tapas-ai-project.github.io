Poster Presentation - Crop Monitoring in Ireland with SAR to Quantify Agricultural Stability and Climate Resilience

This week I attended the ESA FRINGE conference in Leeds on behalf of the TAPAS project. It was a great opportunity to discuss the applications of SAR with world-class experts in the field and I quickly realised how the revolution of SAR Satellite technology can add another dimension to the well-established field of optical earth observation. Though InSAR may not be intuitively applicable to crop monitoring, the weather-independent aspect of this data is extremely valuable. In light of this conference, we hope to further pursue the capability of SAR to model soil moisture, as this will provide valuable insight into irrigation management on a hyperlocal scale. With upcoming missions to increase the fleet of SAR Satellites in orbit, we believe itâ€™s essential to establish viable use cases for the data to come.
