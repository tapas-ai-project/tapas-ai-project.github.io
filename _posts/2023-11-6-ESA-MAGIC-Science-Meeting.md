ESA MAGIC Science and Applications (2–3 NOVEMBER 2023)
Poster Presentation - Upsampling GRACE in the Senegal River Valley using an XGBoost regression model

This week the TAPAS team had the pleasure of attending the MAGIC Science and Applications Workshop hosted by ESA and NASA in Assisi, Italy. It was a truly inspiring few days of lively discussion panels paired with a packed schedule of insightful presentations. It was also a wonderful opportunity for us to discuss the applications of the GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage product to our work on climate-adaptable irrigation practices in the Senegal River Valley. It's fantastic to see such a unique instrument gaining traction in the remote sensing community and the variety of applications being investigated from all corners of the world. We very much look forward to continuing this work and following up on the applications to our small fragmented landscape back home in Ireland.
