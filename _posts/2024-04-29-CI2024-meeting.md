## Climate Informatics 2024 hosted by the Alan Turing Institute

The team virtually attended this 3-day meeting based in London, hosted by the Alan Turing Institute. 

Our work that was communicated to other researchers and journalists attending the event included how to quantify the effect of interventions on agricultural production. 

This is a difficult problem as each intervention is bespoke for the region of interest, therefore there is some customisation required to analyse the adaptation in the region usign remote sensing and AI. 

Our approach combines deep learning with remote sensing to find recent trends in biomass indicators which diverge from historical trends. This technique can be applied to a range of adaptation indicators depending on the nature of the intervention.

This offers a low-cost solution to stakeholders, NGOs, and governmental organisations to assess the success of intervening in agricultural production. It allows the interest party to pin-point successful regions, or if the data exists on the ground, the most successful agricultural policies and practices.
