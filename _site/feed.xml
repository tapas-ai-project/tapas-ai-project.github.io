&lt;p&gt;The TAPAS group provides a powerful toolkit by integrating Earth Observation (EO), and AI solutions to support targeted interventions and advance progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). TAPAS solutions monitor agricultural practice, crop health and land use to offer impartial insight into food production and provide alert systems for areas that are at risk of acute food insecurity. TAPAS provides real-time analyses of climate data and climate modelling to predict extreme climate shock and inform strategies for climate mitigation and adaptation (SDG13).
The TAPAS group facilitates international collaboration to meet ‘Partnerships for the Goals’ (SDG 17) through technology transfer, data sharing and collaboration.  TAPAS has the capacity to monitor Zero Hunger targets (SDG 2) by analysing data to predict crop yields, assess the impact of climate change on agriculture and optimize resource allocation for sustainable food production. It’s service can monitor water-related challenges including pollution events and optimize water resource management.

Poster Presentation - Upsampling GRACE in the Senegal River Valley using an XGBoost regression model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the TAPAS team had the pleasure of attending the MAGIC Science and Applications Workshop hosted by ESA and NASA in Assisi, Italy. It was a truly inspiring few days of lively discussion panels paired with a packed schedule of insightful presentations. It was also a wonderful opportunity for us to discuss the applications of the GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage product to our work on climate-adaptable irrigation practices in the Senegal River Valley. It’s fantastic to see such a unique instrument gaining traction in the remote sensing community and the variety of applications being investigated from all corners of the world. We very much look forward to continuing this work and following up on the applications to our small fragmented landscape back home in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><summary type="html">ESA MAGIC Science and Applications (2–3 NOVEMBER 2023) Poster Presentation - Upsampling GRACE in the Senegal River Valley using an XGBoost regression model</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">ESA FRINGE Sept 2023</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/conferences/workshops/2023/09/20/ESA-FRINGE-Meeting/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ESA FRINGE Sept 2023" /><published>2023-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/conferences/workshops/2023/09/20/ESA-FRINGE-Meeting</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/conferences/workshops/2023/09/20/ESA-FRINGE-Meeting/">&lt;p&gt;Poster Presentation - Crop Monitoring in Ireland with SAR to Quantify Agricultural Stability and Climate Resilience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I attended the ESA FRINGE conference in Leeds on behalf of the TAPAS project. It was a great opportunity to discuss the applications of SAR with world-class experts in the field and I quickly realised how the revolution of SAR Satellite technology can add another dimension to the well-established field of optical earth observation. Though InSAR may not be intuitively applicable to crop monitoring, the weather-independent aspect of this data is extremely valuable. In light of this conference, we hope to further pursue the capability of SAR to model soil moisture, as this will provide valuable insight into irrigation management on a hyperlocal scale. With upcoming missions to increase the fleet of SAR Satellites in orbit, we believe it’s essential to establish viable use cases for the data to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><summary type="html">Poster Presentation - Crop Monitoring in Ireland with SAR to Quantify Agricultural Stability and Climate Resilience</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">ESA PolinSAR Biomass June 2023</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/conferences/workshops/2023/06/25/ESA-PolinSAR-Biomass/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ESA PolinSAR Biomass June 2023" /><published>2023-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/conferences/workshops/2023/06/25/ESA-PolinSAR-Biomass</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/conferences/workshops/2023/06/25/ESA-PolinSAR-Biomass/">&lt;p&gt;Poster Presentation - Quantifying The Impact of Climate-Change-Induced Desertification In Agrifood Production In Senegal Using BIOMASS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending the recent ESA Polinsar &amp;amp; BIOMASS conference in Toulouse last week was an absolute pleasure. The presentations were a very comprehensive insight into the world of Pol-InSAR and its developing applications within a wide variety of fields in EO, from deforestation to desertification. We presented our work on soil moisture retrievals from SAR and had the opportunity to speak with others who are also interested in monitoring soil moisture, particularly in arid climates along the Sahel. This is a topic of increasing interest as water has become one of the most valuable resources in the battle to maintain viable farming practices in the Senegal River Valley. Our team at TAPAS has returned with lots of information to delve into further concerning PolInSAR applications in Climate Change impact monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><summary type="html">Poster Presentation - Quantifying The Impact of Climate-Change-Induced Desertification In Agrifood Production In Senegal Using BIOMASS</summary></entry></feed>
