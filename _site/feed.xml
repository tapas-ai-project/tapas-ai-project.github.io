&lt;p&gt;The TAPAS group were represented at the AI4Copernicus “Benelux day for shared challenges on water, infrastructure and soil monitoring” by Jemima O’Farrell and new group member Pearse Murphy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosted by the Netherlands space office, AI4Copernius was a space for experts in Earth Observation (EO) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to highlight some recent achievements. The meeting was opened with a video message from Mark Harbers, Dutch Minister for Infrastructure and Water Management, who stressed the importance of EO in the face of challenges posed by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team attended thematic sessions dedicated to subsidence monitoring and water, predominantly in a Benelux context. They also learned about different applications of SAR data as part of the radar data for water and soil workshop, which was held one day prior to AI4Copernicus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two days provided the team with a great opportunity to connect with new colleagues and learn how best to implement SAR data within the TAPAS project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><summary type="html">The team attend the AI4Copernicus workshop and conference on soil and water.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/image-2.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EO for Agriculture under pressure 2024</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/conferences/workshops/2024/05/20/EO4AGRI/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EO for Agriculture under pressure 2024" /><published>2024-05-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/conferences/workshops/2024/05/20/EO4AGRI</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/conferences/workshops/2024/05/20/EO4AGRI/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;eo-for-agriculture-under-pressure-worshop-2024&quot;&gt;EO For Agriculture Under Pressure Worshop 2024&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EO4Agri workshop is hosted jointly by the EC and ESA at the ESA headquaters in Frascati, Rome. The even was co-organised by the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and GEOGLAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event broguht together the core community of people working on EO-based science and solutions for agriculture as well as users, including scientists, data and service providers, national and international agencies and other institutions in order to present and discuss state of the art, evolving needs, and priority areas for future projects of Horizon Europe and FutureEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dúalta presented the team’s work on climate adaptation and intervention audits in the Senegal River Valley, work soon to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting was an opportunity for the team to network with individuals working on cutting-edge methods for remote sensing in agriculture, as well as communicating the team’s hard work and results over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team provided recommendations to the EC and ESA moving into the future to intervention based strategies in developing nations with regards to the climate adaptation and food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team virtually attended this 3-day meeting based in London, hosted by the Alan Turing Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work that was communicated to other researchers and journalists attending the event included how to quantify the effect of interventions on agricultural production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a difficult problem as each intervention is bespoke for the region of interest, therefore there is some customisation required to analyse the adaptation in the region usign remote sensing and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach combines deep learning with remote sensing to find recent trends in biomass indicators which diverge from historical trends. This technique can be applied to a range of adaptation indicators depending on the nature of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This offers a low-cost solution to stakeholders, NGOs, and governmental organisations to assess the success of intervening in agricultural production. It allows the interest party to pin-point successful regions, or if the data exists on the ground, the most successful agricultural policies and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

These changes pose a direct threat to the region’s agriculture-dependent economies and the livelihoods of millions. TAPAS has investigations show that in regions such as the Sahel, prolonged droughts have transformed fertile land into arid landscapes unsuitable for agriculture. As a result, communities reliant on farming or nomadic herding must migrate in search of more hospitable ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region already struggling with numerous socio-economic challenges, is increasingly bearing the brunt of climate change. The adverse effects of global warming, combined with the region’s vulnerability, have led to a surge in population displacement. This phenomenon is reshaping the landscape and presenting significant challenges for both the affected communities and policymakers. As temperatures soar and water becomes scarce, arable land diminishes, affecting crop yields and food security.
The correlation between climate change and population displacement in the region is inextricably linked. Rural communities, dependent on agriculture are increasingly vulnerable to the impact of climate shock. Failed harvests and the scarcity of resources force people to migrate. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that many Sub-Saharan African countries lack the infrastructure and resources to adapt to these changes adequately. Limited access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities further complicates the situation, making the affected populations more susceptible to displacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition for water, fertile land, and other essential resources are intensifying leading to resource-related conflicts as the scarcity of resources induced by climate change often sparks conflict among communities and escalates existing tensions.
Addressing the challenges of climate-induced population displacement requires a multi-faceted approach. Governments in the affected regions need to prioritize sustainable development, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, and implement policies that foster adaptation and mitigation strategies. International cooperation is equally crucial. Developed nations and international organizations must contribute resources and expertise to support climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts across the region. This includes funding for renewable energy projects, sustainable agricultural practices, and the development of early warning systems for extreme weather events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change-induced population displacement in the region demands urgent action. As the region grapples with the impacts of a changing climate, governments, international organizations, and communities must collaborate to find sustainable solutions. By addressing the root causes and implementing adaptive measures, we can mitigate the impact of climate change on vulnerable populations and foster resilience in the face of an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TAPAS group provides a powerful toolkit by integrating Earth Observation (EO), and AI solutions to support targeted interventions and advance progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). TAPAS solutions monitor agricultural practice, crop health and land use to offer impartial insight into food production and provide alert systems for areas that are at risk of acute food insecurity. TAPAS provides real-time analyses of climate data and climate modelling to predict extreme climate shock and inform strategies for climate mitigation and adaptation (SDG13).
The TAPAS group facilitates international collaboration to meet ‘Partnerships for the Goals’ (SDG 17) through technology transfer, data sharing and collaboration.  TAPAS has the capacity to monitor Zero Hunger targets (SDG 2) by analysing data to predict crop yields, assess the impact of climate change on agriculture and optimize resource allocation for sustainable food production. It’s service can monitor water-related challenges including pollution events and optimize water resource management.

Poster Presentation - Upsampling GRACE in the Senegal River Valley using an XGBoost regression model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the TAPAS team had the pleasure of attending the MAGIC Science and Applications Workshop hosted by ESA and NASA in Assisi, Italy. It was a truly inspiring few days of lively discussion panels paired with a packed schedule of insightful presentations. It was also a wonderful opportunity for us to discuss the applications of the GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage product to our work on climate-adaptable irrigation practices in the Senegal River Valley. It’s fantastic to see such a unique instrument gaining traction in the remote sensing community and the variety of applications being investigated from all corners of the world. We very much look forward to continuing this work and following up on the applications to our small fragmented landscape back home in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I attended the ESA FRINGE conference in Leeds on behalf of the TAPAS project. It was a great opportunity to discuss the applications of SAR with world-class experts in the field and I quickly realised how the revolution of SAR Satellite technology can add another dimension to the well-established field of optical earth observation. Though InSAR may not be intuitively applicable to crop monitoring, the weather-independent aspect of this data is extremely valuable. In light of this conference, we hope to further pursue the capability of SAR to model soil moisture, as this will provide valuable insight into irrigation management on a hyperlocal scale. With upcoming missions to increase the fleet of SAR Satellites in orbit, we believe it’s essential to establish viable use cases for the data to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending the recent ESA Polinsar &amp;amp; BIOMASS conference in Toulouse last week was an absolute pleasure. The presentations were a very comprehensive insight into the world of Pol-InSAR and its developing applications within a wide variety of fields in EO, from deforestation to desertification. We presented our work on soil moisture retrievals from SAR and had the opportunity to speak with others who are also interested in monitoring soil moisture, particularly in arid climates along the Sahel. This is a topic of increasing interest as water has become one of the most valuable resources in the battle to maintain viable farming practices in the Senegal River Valley. Our team at TAPAS has returned with lots of information to delve into further concerning PolInSAR applications in Climate Change impact monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
