These changes pose a direct threat to the region’s agriculture-dependent economies and the livelihoods of millions. TAPAS has investigations show that in regions such as the Sahel, prolonged droughts have transformed fertile land into arid landscapes unsuitable for agriculture. As a result, communities reliant on farming or nomadic herding must migrate in search of more hospitable ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region already struggling with numerous socio-economic challenges, is increasingly bearing the brunt of climate change. The adverse effects of global warming, combined with the region’s vulnerability, have led to a surge in population displacement. This phenomenon is reshaping the landscape and presenting significant challenges for both the affected communities and policymakers. As temperatures soar and water becomes scarce, arable land diminishes, affecting crop yields and food security.
The correlation between climate change and population displacement in the region is inextricably linked. Rural communities, dependent on agriculture are increasingly vulnerable to the impact of climate shock. Failed harvests and the scarcity of resources force people to migrate. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that many Sub-Saharan African countries lack the infrastructure and resources to adapt to these changes adequately. Limited access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities further complicates the situation, making the affected populations more susceptible to displacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition for water, fertile land, and other essential resources are intensifying leading to resource-related conflicts as the scarcity of resources induced by climate change often sparks conflict among communities and escalates existing tensions.
Addressing the challenges of climate-induced population displacement requires a multi-faceted approach. Governments in the affected regions need to prioritize sustainable development, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, and implement policies that foster adaptation and mitigation strategies. International cooperation is equally crucial. Developed nations and international organizations must contribute resources and expertise to support climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts across the region. This includes funding for renewable energy projects, sustainable agricultural practices, and the development of early warning systems for extreme weather events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change-induced population displacement in the region demands urgent action. As the region grapples with the impacts of a changing climate, governments, international organizations, and communities must collaborate to find sustainable solutions. By addressing the root causes and implementing adaptive measures, we can mitigate the impact of climate change on vulnerable populations and foster resilience in the face of an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TAPAS group provides a powerful toolkit by integrating Earth Observation (EO), and AI solutions to support targeted interventions and advance progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). TAPAS solutions monitor agricultural practice, crop health and land use to offer impartial insight into food production and provide alert systems for areas that are at risk of acute food insecurity. TAPAS provides real-time analyses of climate data and climate modelling to predict extreme climate shock and inform strategies for climate mitigation and adaptation (SDG13).
The TAPAS group facilitates international collaboration to meet ‘Partnerships for the Goals’ (SDG 17) through technology transfer, data sharing and collaboration.  TAPAS has the capacity to monitor Zero Hunger targets (SDG 2) by analysing data to predict crop yields, assess the impact of climate change on agriculture and optimize resource allocation for sustainable food production. It’s service can monitor water-related challenges including pollution events and optimize water resource management.

The discussions, sessions and plenary talks with a wide range of participants from scientists, experts, and decision-makers to global governments, industry, private and public sectors centred on accelerating the transformation of rice-based food systems. Specialized events and activities of interest to all stakeholders, from the scientific and research communities to National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems (NARES) and regional development organizations presented evidence-based solutions to the principal challenges facing the global rice sector.&lt;/p&gt;

Poster Presentation - Upsampling GRACE in the Senegal River Valley using an XGBoost regression model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the TAPAS team had the pleasure of attending the MAGIC Science and Applications Workshop hosted by ESA and NASA in Assisi, Italy. It was a truly inspiring few days of lively discussion panels paired with a packed schedule of insightful presentations. It was also a wonderful opportunity for us to discuss the applications of the GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage product to our work on climate-adaptable irrigation practices in the Senegal River Valley. It’s fantastic to see such a unique instrument gaining traction in the remote sensing community and the variety of applications being investigated from all corners of the world. We very much look forward to continuing this work and following up on the applications to our small fragmented landscape back home in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I attended the ESA FRINGE conference in Leeds on behalf of the TAPAS project. It was a great opportunity to discuss the applications of SAR with world-class experts in the field and I quickly realised how the revolution of SAR Satellite technology can add another dimension to the well-established field of optical earth observation. Though InSAR may not be intuitively applicable to crop monitoring, the weather-independent aspect of this data is extremely valuable. In light of this conference, we hope to further pursue the capability of SAR to model soil moisture, as this will provide valuable insight into irrigation management on a hyperlocal scale. With upcoming missions to increase the fleet of SAR Satellites in orbit, we believe it’s essential to establish viable use cases for the data to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending the recent ESA Polinsar &amp;amp; BIOMASS conference in Toulouse last week was an absolute pleasure. The presentations were a very comprehensive insight into the world of Pol-InSAR and its developing applications within a wide variety of fields in EO, from deforestation to desertification. We presented our work on soil moisture retrievals from SAR and had the opportunity to speak with others who are also interested in monitoring soil moisture, particularly in arid climates along the Sahel. This is a topic of increasing interest as water has become one of the most valuable resources in the battle to maintain viable farming practices in the Senegal River Valley. Our team at TAPAS has returned with lots of information to delve into further concerning PolInSAR applications in Climate Change impact monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the team attended the AI4Copernicus meeting in Mondorf-les-Bains in Luxembourg. Many leading organisations in orbital imagery were present, giving updates on the current impactful use cases for the latest suite of satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team presented research using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to map out cropping regions in the Senegal River Valley. Using time-series to image transformations applied in a novel way to this satellite data, we were not only able to map the extent of rice cropping in this area, but also the cropping intensity for each year. 
This gives decision and policy makers much more nuanced information on the impact that current strategies are having on crop production levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used infrared and optical imagery from Sentinel-2 to create a preliminary crop mask, which is then used to train a random forest model which distinguishes cropped rice from other land use types. This rice mask then provides the basis for data extraction of time-series data from Sentinel-1 (VH) and Sentinel-2 (NDVI, NDYI), which are strong indicators of the phenology of the rice growth cycle. Gramian Angular Fields (GAF) were applied to the time-series to produce 3-channel imagery which can be used to classify the calendar year into single crop, double crop or fallow years of rice growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of analysis gives an indepth view of rice production trends in a region which is increasingly reliant on consistent rice yields, particularly given the slow-down in global rice exports. Senegal still aims to be rice self-sufficient in the future, but as yet to achieve that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
